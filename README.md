## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations & Insights  

| **Monthly Sales Trend** | **Revenue Distribution** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/1.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/2.png" width="400"> |
| Peak in April â€“ Revenue hit â‚¹16.7M, the highest in the dataset.Declining Trend â€“ Revenue fell 15% in May (â‚¹14.5M) and another 17% in June (â‚¹12.2M).Q2 Drives 100% Sales â€“ Entire revenue (â‚¹43.4M) comes from just 3 months, showing extreme sales concentration. | Most sales volume comes from **â‚¹200â€“â‚¹1,000 orders**, revenue is driven by **mid-to-high value and outlier purchases**, forming **three customer bands: budget (<â‚¹200), core (â‚¹200â€“â‚¹1,000), and premium (>â‚¹1,500)**.|

| **Category Distribution** | **Size Distribution** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/3.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/4.png" width="400"> |
| Sales are **heavily concentrated**, with T-Shirts and Shirts driving **83% of total sales**, followed by a sharp drop in Blazers and Trousers. This creates clear tiers: **top-performers to prioritize**, **mid-tier needing growth**, and **underperformers (e.g., Watch, 3 units)** that may warrant discontinuation.| Mid-range sizes (M, L, XL, XXL, and S) dominate demand with over 78% of total orders, while extreme sizes like XS and 4XLâ€“6XL contribute less than 1% each, highlighting a strong size concentration; hence, inventory should focus heavily on popular mid-range sizes, with minimal stocking or phasing out of low-demand extremes to optimize costs and prevent unsold stock. |

| **Category + Size Combination Analysis** | **Top Selling Products** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/5.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/6.png" width="400"> |
| Sales show **size-specific leadership**, with T-shirts dominating smaller sizes (XS, S, M) and shirts leading larger sizes (L, XL, XXL), while T-shirts and shirts consistently outperform Blazers and Trousers across most sizes. Extreme sizes (4XLâ€“6XL) see minimal demand across all categories, with only shirts and T-shirts receiving occasional orders, indicating that the market for these sizes is a small niche served mainly by the top-performing products.| The sales distribution follows the **80/20 rule**, with T-Shirts and Shirts alone accounting for **77.4%** of units sold, and the top three categories (T-Shirt, Shirt, Blazer) driving **89.4%** of total sales, while the remaining six categories contribute less than 11%, highlighting that the bulk of revenue comes from a small subset of products and the long tail has minimal impact.|

| **Effectiveness (Delivery vs Cancellation)** | **Buying Behaviour Segmentation** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/7.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/8.png" width="400"> |
| Amazon-fulfilled orders are highly reliable, with **93.4% delivered successfully** and only **6.6% cancelled**, whereas Merchant-fulfilled orders face a **17.5% cancellation rate**â€”nearly three times higherâ€”indicating stock, shipping, or efficiency issues; overall, Amazon ensures a much better customer experience, while Merchants must reduce cancellations to remain competitive.| Customer purchase analysis reveals that **94% of buyers are one-time customers**, highlighting a severe retention gap and low brand loyalty, while average spend is modest (\~â‚¹586) with most orders between â‚¹500â€“â‚¹1,000, though a small premium segment exists. Revenue is heavily driven by **T-shirts (â‚¹3.8 Cr) and Shirts (â‚¹2 Cr)**, with accessories contributing minimally but offering cross-sell opportunities. Overall, the business should focus on **retention through loyalty programs and personalized campaigns**, **increase average order value via upselling and bundles**, and **leverage accessories to supplement apparel-driven revenue**.|

| **High-Value vs Low-Value Customers** | **Best Selling Cities from Top States** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/9.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/10.png" width="400"> |
| The customer base is **dominated by low-value buyers (86.7% spending <â‚¹1000)**, with a small medium-value segment (12.4% spending â‚¹1000â€“â‚¹2000) and very few high-value customers (0.8% spending >â‚¹2000), indicating heavy reliance on volume. To grow sustainably, the business should use **loyalty programs and targeted offers** to move low-value buyers up, **retain high-value customers** with personalized benefits, and promote the purchasing patterns of medium/high-value groups to the larger low-value segment.| Maharashtra leads sales with â‚¹1.3 Cr, driven largely by Mumbai (27% of state sales), followed by Karnataka at â‚¹1.0 Cr with Bengaluru contributing \~67%, making it the top single-city performer. Telangana and Tamil Nadu are heavily city-centric (Hyderabad, Chennai), while Delhiâ€™s sales are almost entirely from New Delhi. In contrast, states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, and Haryana have more evenly distributed demand across multiple cities. Overall, **Mumbai and Bengaluru are the most critical markets**, while other states offer opportunities through broader city-level engagement.|
